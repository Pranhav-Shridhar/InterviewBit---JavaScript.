// What is the distinction between client-side and server-side JavaScript?

// Client-side JavaScript is made up of two parts, a fundamental language and predefined objects for performing JavaScript in a browser. JavaScript for the client is automatically included in the HTML pages. At runtime, the browser understands this script.


// Client-side JavaScript is similar to server-side JavaScript. It includes JavaScript that will execute on a server. Only after processing is the server-side JavaScript deployed.
