// What do mean by prototype design pattern?

// The Prototype Pattern produces different objects, but instead of returning uninitialized objects, it produces objects that have values replicated from a template – or sample – object. Also known as the Properties pattern, the Prototype pattern is used to create prototypes.

// The introduction of business objects with parameters that match the database's default settings is a good example of where the Prototype pattern comes in handy. The default settings for a newly generated business object are stored in the prototype object.

// The Prototype pattern is hardly used in traditional languages, however, it is used in the development of new objects and templates in JavaScript, which is a prototypal language.
