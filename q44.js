// Difference between prototypal and classical inheritance

// Programers build objects, which are representations of real-time entities, in traditional OO programming. Classes and objects are the two sorts of abstractions. A class is a generalization of an object, whereas an object is an abstraction of an actual thing. A Vehicle, for example, is a specialization of a Car. As a result, automobiles (class) are descended from vehicles (object).

// Classical inheritance differs from prototypal inheritance in that classical inheritance is confined to classes that inherit from those remaining classes, but prototypal inheritance allows any object to be cloned via an object linking method. Despite going into too many specifics, a prototype essentially serves as a template for those other objects, whether they extend the parent object or not.
