// Difference between var and let keyword in javascript.

// Some differences are 

// From the very beginning, the 'var' keyword was used in JavaScript programming whereas the keyword 'let' was just added in 2015.
// The keyword 'Var' has function scope. Anywhere in the function, the variable specified using var is accessible but in ‘let’ the scope of a variable declared with the 'let' keyword is limited to the block in which it is declared. Let's start with a Block Scope.
// 'var' declares a variable that will be hoisted but 'let' declares a variable that will not be hoisted.



console.log(typeof a);

var a = 10;

let b= 12;
