// What is the role of deferred scripts in JavaScript?

// The processing of HTML code while the page loads are disabled by nature till the script hasn't halted. Your page will be affected if your network is a bit slow, or if the script is very hefty. When you use Deferred, the script waits for the HTML parser to finish before executing it. This reduces the time it takes for web pages to load, allowing them to appear more quickly.


// <script src="demo_defer.js" defer></script>
