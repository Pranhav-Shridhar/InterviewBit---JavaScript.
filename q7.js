// Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?

// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is checked during run-time in contrast to a statically typed language, where the type of a variable is checked during compile-time.

// For example, a variable that is assigned a number type can be converted to a string type:

var a = 23;
var a = "Hello World!";
