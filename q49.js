// What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?

// A primitive is a data type that isn't composed of other data types. It's only capable of displaying one value at a time. By definition, every primitive is a built-in data type (the compiler must be knowledgeable of them) nevertheless, not all built-in datasets are primitives. In JavaScript, there are 5 different forms of basic data. The following values are available:

// Boolean
// Undefined
// Null
// Number
// String
