// What are arrow functions?

// Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. They provide us with a new and shorter syntax for declaring functions. Arrow functions can only be used as a function expression.

// Traditional Function Expression
var add = function(a,b){
    return a + b;
  }
  
  // Arrow Function Expression
  var arrowAdd = (a,b) => a + b;
